          How are MCQs made?

          The following is a guide on how teachers and tutors create MCQs.
          MCQGen uses AI algorithms to mimic the human MCQ creation process.

          1. Identifying Key Sentences
        </h3>
        <p className='mcq-made-paragraph'>
          We start with identifying key sentences that carry key concepts from any given text.

        <img src={heroImage4} alt="Identifying Key Sentences"style={{margin: '4% 0 2% 15%'}}/>

          2. Extracting Keywords from Sentences
        </h3>
        <p className='mcq-made-paragraph'>
          From the key sentences, we identify keywords and key phrases that form the correct answer to which questions are created.

          3. Forming an MCQ
        </h3>
        <p className='mcq-made-paragraph'>
          After we extract a keyword or keyphrase (correct answer), we use AI algorithms to generate a question from the key sentence such that the extracted keyword or keyphrase is the right answer. For a given generated question and right answer pair, we generate relevant distractors (wrong answer choices) using another AI algorithm to generate the complete Multiple Choice Question (MCQ).
